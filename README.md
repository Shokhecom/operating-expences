Operating Expences to financial statements

Operating expenses are the costs incurred by a business in its normal operations, such as rent, utilities, salaries, and marketing. They are shown on the balance sheet as a liability, meaning that they reduce the net worth of the business. Operating expenses do not directly generate revenue or profit for the business, unlike the costs of goods sold or the costs of services rendered. Therefore, they are not considered assets, which are resources that can be used to create value for the business.

The following are common examples of operating expenses:

    Rent and utilities.
    Wages and salaries.
    Accounting and legal fees.
    Overhead costs such as selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A)
    Property taxes.
    Business travel.
    Interest paid on debt.
    Research and development (R&D) expenses.
